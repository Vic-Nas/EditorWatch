# Extension Icon

For the VS Code extension, you need an icon.png file (128x128 pixels).

## Quick Options:

### Option 1: Use a simple emoji-based icon
Create a 128x128 PNG with an eye emoji 👁️ or code symbol </> on a gradient background.

### Option 2: AI-generated
Use DALL-E, Midjourney, or similar to generate:
"Minimalist icon for code monitoring extension, eye watching code, purple and blue gradient, 128x128"

### Option 3: Design tools
- Canva (free): canva.com
- Figma (free): figma.com
- Export as PNG, 128x128px

## Temporary solution:
The extension will work without an icon, but the marketplace requires one for publication.

Place the final icon.png in the extension/ directory before publishing.
